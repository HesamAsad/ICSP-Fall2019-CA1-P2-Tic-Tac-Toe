### Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a simple two-player game. To start the game, a table with three rows and three columns is drawn on each page and each side has one of the symbols O or X and use it to fill the cells of the table until the end of the game. 

In this project, we implement this game using C programming language.
